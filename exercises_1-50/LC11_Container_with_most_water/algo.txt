Solution with 2 pointers. Set left to 0 and right to last index of array. Set maxarea to 0. In while loop until left is less than right, find currentMinHeight which is minimum between height[left] and height[right]. Calculate intermediate area, compare with maxarea and assign what is bigger to maxarea. If height[left] less or equal right, increase left pointer, otherwise decrease right pointer. Return maxarea when loop is finished.
