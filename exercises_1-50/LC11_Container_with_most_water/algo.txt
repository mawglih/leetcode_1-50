Solution with 2 pointers. Set left to 0 and right to last index of array.Set maxarea to 0. In while loop until left is less than right, find surrentMinHeight which is minimum betwwn heaigh[left] and height[right]. Calculate intermediate area. compare with maxarea and assign what is bigger to maxarea. If height[left] less or equal right, increase left pointer, otherwise decrfease right pointer. Return max area when loop is finished.
