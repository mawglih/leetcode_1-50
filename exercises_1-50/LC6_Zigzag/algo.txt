Check the edge cases. Create down variable as true, curr index as 1 and new 2D array with known number of rows. Run for loop until length of the string. start from index 0, that is curr - 1. check down variable, if it is true increase current by 1 and check if it is greater than numRows. Set current to numRows - 1 and down to false. If down is false, decrease currwnt by 1, check if current is less than 1, set it equal to 2 and set down to true. That will mak to move up and down in zigzag motion populating array on each itteration. Return string by joining an array.
