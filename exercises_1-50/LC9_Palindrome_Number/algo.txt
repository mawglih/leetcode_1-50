Save x in temp variable. Create edge cases - negative x is never palindrome. 0 x is always palindrome. For the rest of positive x, run while loop, where build a string of x in reverse order. Get a remain dividing by 10, remove last digits by parseInt(temp / 10). add to resultprevious result multiplied by 10 and remain. When temp becomes 0, break out the loop,  compare number x and result in return statement.
