Create a hashmap object or Map(). In the for loop check what value is needed to get to target by subtracting current value from target. If compensator is inside the hashmap, result is found as a current index (value of i) and key of compensator in hashmap. If not found add new key (i) and value (current value) to hashmap and continue. If not result found return -1 or false or null, depending on what the task is asking.
