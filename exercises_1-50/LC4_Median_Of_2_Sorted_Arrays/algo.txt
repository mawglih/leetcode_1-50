First approach.
Use [... ], to join arrays and then sort function to sort them.
Check if length is odd or even. Calculate median member.

Second approach
Create a function to find median. Join two sorted arrays using 2 pointers. When adding to new array add smaller number and increase its pointer. WHen done, return median of new array.
