Start a for loop to loop over first triplet member. At every iteration set a target as opposite of first member (* -1). Select left and right, since array is sorted. and point left to i + 1 and right to last index of array. Using while loop try to find second and third members of tiplet or move to next i. Also check if similar triplet exists. Push all triplets to array and return it.
