Set edge cases. 
Create a helper function that checks the match of the first char. Call it recursively. 
If length of first string greater than 0 and first char of p is equal '.' or equal first char of s.
if not: if second char of p is '*', then call isMatch again but slice p from second char, however check is firstchamatch is true and slice of s from index 1 and p matches.
Return true or false if isMatch(s.slice(1), p.slice(1)) is ture or false if first char is matched.
